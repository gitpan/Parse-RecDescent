                 Release of version 1.78 of Parse::RecDescent
==============================================================================


NAME

    Parse::RecDescent - generate recursive-descent parsers


DESCRIPTION

    RecDescent incrementally generates top-down recursive-descent text
    parsers from simple yacc-like grammar specifications. It provides:

        * Regular expressions or literal strings as terminals (tokens),

        * Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule,

        * Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within productions,

	* Late-bound (run-time dispatched) subrules

        * Full access to Perl within actions specified as part of the grammar,

        * Simple automated error reporting during parser generation and parsing,

        * The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject particular
          productions during a parse,

        * Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even during a parse),

	* Precompilation of parser objects,

	* User-definable reduce-reduce conflict resolution via
	  "scoring" of matching productions.

    See the file "RecDescent.pod" for excruciating detail on all of this.


LIMITATIONS

    * There's no support for parsing directly from an input stream.

    * The generator doesn't handle left-recursion.


PREREQUISITES

    Parse::RecDescent requires Text::Balanced, which is included in the
    distribution.


INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm files in their appropriate
    local Perl subdirectories.


CHANGES AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

    This readme refers to versions 1.XX.
    For details of changes, refer to the file Changes.

    Version 2.00 will provide a cleaner interface and better
    parsing performance.

                 Release of version 1.35 of Parse::RecDescent
==============================================================================

DESCRIPTION

NAME

    Parse::RecDescent - generate recursive-descent parsers


DESCRIPTION

    RecDescent incrementally generates top-down recursive-descent text
    parsers from simple yacc-like grammar specifications. It provides:

        * Regular expressions or literal strings as terminals (tokens),

        * Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule,

        * Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within productions,

	* Late-bound (run-time dispatched) subrules

        * Full access to Perl within actions specified as part of the grammar,

        * Simple automated error reporting during parser generation and parsing,

        * The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject particular
          productions during a parse,

        * Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even during a parse),

        * The ability to retrieve the generated parsing code.

    See the file "RecDescent.pod" for excruciating detail on all of this.


LIMITATIONS

    * There's no support for parsing directly from an input stream.

    * The generator doesn't handle left-recursion.


PREREQUISITES

    Parse::RecDescent requires Text::Balanced, which is included in the
    distribution.


INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm files in their appropriate
    local Perl subdirectories.


CHANGES AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

    This readme refers to versions 1.XX.
    For details of changes, refer to the file Changes.

    Version 2.00 will provide an optional parser compiler to generate
    separate parsing modules with no construction run-time overhead.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.35


	- Removed "foreach my $var ( @list )" constructs,
	  which were biting users with perl 5.003 and earlier.

	- Fixed bug calling &Parse::RecDescent::toksepcode
	  instead of &Parse::RecDescent::Rule::toksepcode

	- Changed grammar so that colons in rule definitions
	  must appear on the same line as the rule name
	  (as documented). Added an explicit error message
	  when this is not the case.

	- Added $thiscolumn, which indicates the current 
	  column at any point in the parse.

	- Added $thisoffset, which indicates the absolute
	  position in the original text string at any
	  point in the parse.

	- Added $prevline and $prevcolumn, which indicate
	  line and column of the last char of the last
	  successfully matched item.

	- Added @itempos which provides:

		$itempos[$n]{offset}{from}
		$itempos[$n]{offset}{to}
		$itempos[$n]{line}{from}
		$itempos[$n]{line}{to}
		$itempos[$n]{column}{from}
		$itempos[$n]{column}{to}

	  corresponding to each $item[$n].
	  See new documentation.

	- Several trivial lexical changes to make xemacs happy
